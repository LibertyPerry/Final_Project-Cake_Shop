# Final_Project-Cake_Shop

## Synopsis
This is a program that is disigned for a cake shop. The customer can simply run the code and decide what they want for there cake. (ex Number of tiers, Flavor of cake, Icing type and color, decorations, and lettering)

## Motivation
I build this so that I was an easy way for a customer to input what they want and get a price for what they want. 

## How to run
Only the Cake_Shop file is needed to run the program.
